#elementary symbolic logic#

This bibliography covers the basics of symbolic logic - the study of formal reasoning through the manipulation of symbols, a topic that includes propositional logic (involving the logical relationships between atomic statements) and first-order predicate logic (which extends this analysis to statements broken down into atomic subjects, predicates, quantifiers, and variable subjects).  The study of symbolic logic provides insight into logical fallacies, mathematical proof, and boolean logic, among other scientific and mathematical topics.  Higher-order, non-classical, and informal logics are beyond the scope of this bibliography.

**Prerequisites:**

No prerequisite knowledge is necessary to study symbolic logic.  Introductory texts will start from the most basic definitions and truth tables for logical operators, so previous experience with logic is not required.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to learn symbolic logic should obtain an elementary textbook. A good text should begin with the basic ideas of propositional logic - that atomic statements can be either true or false, and that truth tables define the operators "and", "or", "not", "if...then", and "if and only if" that combine these atomic statements to express logical relationships.  Truth tables involving combinations of statements can be used to demonstrate the logical equivalence of different statements (e.g. "not A and B" is the same as "not-A or not-B"). The resulting logical rules can be used to build arguments - from a set of atomic and complex statements, a valid proof will show that a conclusion must necessarily follow.  Truth table analysis will also identify logical fallacies, arguments that appear to be proper but are logically invalid.  A classic example is the following: "if it is raining, then the sidewalk is wet" and "the sidewalk is wet" does not imply "it is raining" - this fallacy is known as *affirming the consequent*.  Simple intuition tells us that this form is invalid because the sidewalk could be wet for some other reason, and a truth table will verify that these two statements do not imply the conclusion.

After a survey of propositional logic, readers should continue on to study first-order predicate logic.  Predicate logic divides atomic statements into subject and predicate; "Spot is a dog" might be represented by "s" in propositional logic, but might be represented by "Ds" in predicate logic, where "D" is the predicate "____ is a dog" and "s" represents the individual constant "Spot".  This allows the representation of statements involving universal and existential quantifiers - non-specific statements that refer to either all individuals or at least one individual, respectively.  These quantifiers are particularly important in the statement of mathematical theorems.
plaintext
Readers should read and study each of these topics, but it is extremely important to work many problems as well.  Create your own truth tables, try to find equivalent statements of your own, prove the validity of the basic forms of argument, show that fallacies are invalid, and construct your own arguments.  Much like mathematics, the only way to internalize the rules of symbolic logic is to practice using them.  Upon completing a study of elementary symbolic logic, readers may wish to go on to study further topics in formal logic like non-classical or higher-order logics, a broader study of logic to include informal logic, or methods of mathematical proof as preparation for a study of formal mathematics.

#Basic Algebra#

Basic (or elementary) algebra extends arithmetic by introducing symbols known as variables that do not represent a specific number but any number to be inserted later.   The goal of algebra is to manipulate expressions that involve these variables in order to study general relationships.  For example, the equation "A = lw" can be used to express that the area of *any* rectangle is equal to its length times its width - replacing "l" and "w" with specific measurements will find the area of an actual rectangle. Using algebra, this equation can be changed into "l = A/w", which tells us that the length of any rectangle is equal to its area divided by its width.  The ability to easily manipulate algebraic equations in a variety of ways is essential to studying more complex mathematical techniques.

Basic algebra should be distinguished from "algebra" in general, which is a branch of mathematics that manipulates symbols in the context of more complex structures with different properties than ordinary numbers; this more advanced field is sometimes called modern (or abstract) algebra.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers who wish to study basic algebra must have mastered arithmetic.  They should have the basic mathematical facts (one-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) memorized.  If these have not been memorized, readers should practice these math facts using flashcards until they can be recited automatically.  The most common reason for difficulty in learning algebra is not having a sufficiently strong foundation in basic arithmetic.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should obtain a mathematically-rigorous introductory textbook appropriate to their current level.  Textbooks must be read chapter-by-chapter, and it is extremely important to work as many problems found in this text as possible.  Just as you can only achieve fluency in a language by speaking it frequently, you can only achieve proficiency in algebra by using it to solve a large number of problems.  It may be helpful to purchase additional textbooks that provide additional problems or alternative explanations; there are also online tutorials and videos that might be helpful.

By the end of a study of basic algebra, it is very important that readers be able to manipulate algebraic expressions and equations with fluency.   Readers who go on to study higher math will have to simplify and solve algebraic equations while applying more complex techniques, and unless it is second nature, readers will struggle with the algebra instead of learning the new techniques.

After mastering algebra, the next goal is calculus, which is the mathematical foundation of science and its laws.  It is possible to go from algebra directly into calculus, but readers may benefit from studying precalculus first - the idea behind this is to cover important topics in trigonometry and analytic geometry beforehand so that students can focus exclusively on the calculus.  Going on to study calculus will enable readers to begin learning the physical sciences and engineering.

**Subtopics:**


#Pre-Calculus#

Precalculus encompasses mathematical knowledge useful to those who have taken high school algebra and are preparing to learn university-level calculus.  Although readers who have taken algebra *can* move straight into calculus, it is recommended to learn the important background topics from precalculus ahead of time so that readers can focus exclusively on the concepts of calculus.  The topics that should be studied in precalculus course can be grouped into three subjects: algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry (which should cover the definition of a function).

**Prerequisites:**

Readers should have a solid grasp of arithmetic before attempting to prepare for calculus.  It is very important to have basic arithmetic facts memorized - if you struggle with arithmetic, you'll struggle with algebra.  If you struggle with algebra, you'll struggle with calculus and so on until you decide that you are someone who is "not good at math".  But there are no people who are inherently bad at math, only those who lack sufficient preparation.  If you don't have the arithmetic tables memorized, it is very important to get a deck of flashcards and practice until they're automatic.

Readers should also have a basic familiarity with algebra.  You should understand the basic rules of algebra and be able to manipulate equations, but may still need to write down every step in solving an equation.  Algebra should be practiced diligently alongside the newer topics in trigonometry and analytic geometry.  By the time you finish precalculus, you should be able to do algebra quickly and easily.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should obtain a precalculus textbook and work through each of the important topics chapter-by-chapter, solving as many problems as possible at the end of each section.  As these books can be pricy, readers may want to purchase older editions, which will be far less expensive.  A good preparation for calculus involves three topics - algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry.  Standard precalculus texts do not focus on algebra, so if more practice with algebra is needed, it is recommended that you also pick up a supplementary text (see also the [basic algebra bibliography](http://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/36ltzk/math_basic_algebra/)).  Readers who are new to mathematics may find some textbook explanations difficult - use supplemental videos and online materials to get additional information on topics you find difficult.  But as with any mathematical technique, the only way to learn is by solving many problems - be sure to work as many problems as possible from your textbook.

*More than anything else, the key to getting prepared for a college-level calculus is being able to manipulate algebraic expressions with fluency.*   Readers who struggle with symbols and equations, won't be focused on learning the underlying concepts in calculus.  So it is very important to be *comfortable* with algebra before starting calculus.  And the only way to do this is to practice algebra correctly - play with the algebra - until it feels natural.  You should be able to look at equations like "2/3 x - 9 = 5" and see how these numbers move from one side to the other to end up with "x = 21".  Practice your algebra diligently and you will set yourself up for success in calculus.

Trigonometry is encountered in calculus primarily because of its importance in physics and higher math - it is not essential to the concepts of elementary calculus, but will be encountered in problems and examples.  Readers should understand what trigonometric ratios are and be able to explain what sine, cosine, and tangent mean using a right triangle inscribed within a unit circle.  It will also be helpful to learn how to simplify trigonometric expressions using the most important identities.

In basic Algebraic Geometry, algebraic equations are studied by graphing them in the Cartesian coordinate system.  Readers should at least learn the definition of a function, how to graph a function, how to interpret and work with graphs, and the functions associated with the conic sections (e.g. the parabola).  There are a standard set of graphs and functions used in calculus as examples such as parabolas, hyperbolas, and the trigonometric functions, and readers should become familiar enough with these to be able to draw them on a graph from their algebraic form.

#Proof Techniques#

Proof is essential to the structure of mathematics; it provides mathematical statements with a certainty that is impossible in virtually every other field of intellectual inquiry.  A valid proof provides an absolute link between established axioms and truths of mathematics and a new piece of mathematical knowledge known as a theorem.  Proficiency with these techniques is a prerequisite to the study of higher mathematics.  This bibliography covers the basic methods that are used to contruct a proof of a theorem, while proof theory, computer-assisted proof, and other topics in mathematical logic are outside its scope.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers can study methods of proof without any prior knowledge.  However, familiarity with basic propositional and first order logic may be helpful, since proofs are essentially informal arguments with an underlying formal logical structure.  For example, one of the basic proof techniques is proving the contrapositive rather than the original statement of a theorem, and readers who have studied logic will immediately understand why the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the conditional statement itself.   Many introductory proof textbooks will contain these aspects of formal logic, so a separate study is not strictly necessary.

It is difficult to demonstrate the methods of proof without having something to prove, and so different introductory texts will typically assume (or explain) some background mathematical knowledge.  Readers should check that the sources they use do not assume too much knowledge beyond their current level; however this will not usually pose an insurmountable problem for those familiar with elementary mathematics and algebra.

**Where to Start:**

Readers wanting to learn how to construct proofs should obtain an introductory textbook.  Proof techniques should be learned in two steps: first understand how the strategy works, then use that technique to  prove simple mathematical statements until the proof strategy becomes second nature.  For example, to understand proof by contradiction you must first understand the idea behind the technique - statements can only be true or false, so if you can demonstrate that it is impossible for a statement to be false by deriving a contradicton, then the statement must be true - then practice it by proving statements; the classic example of proof by contradiction is the proof that the square root of two is irrational: if you assume that the square root of two is a reduced fraction a/b, you can show that a,b must have the factor 2 in common, which contradicts the assumption that a/b is a reduced fraction, and therefore the square root of two must be irrational.  Choose many simple mathematical statements and practice using each strategy several times.

Readers who complete a study of proof methods should understand the conditional structure of theorems, understand how to write concise proofs, and know the following proof methods: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proving the contrapositive, proof by exhaustion (cases), existence and uniqueness proofs, universal and existential quantifiers and counterexamples, proving biconditional statements, and mathematical induction.  After completing this study, readers will be prepared to study formal mathematics, although it is advisible to study basic math through elementary calculus before beginning work on pure mathematics.  Good places to start are real analysis, discrete mathematics, or number theory.

#singlevariable_calculus#

Calculus is a set of mathematical techniques based on applying the idea of limit to functions, which makes it possible to study the rate at which a function changes at one specific instant rather than just its average rate of change over a finite period of time.  The techniques of calculus are the foundation of physical science, and so it is no coincidence that calculus and modern physics were born simultaneously through the work of Sir Isaac Newton and his contemporaries.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers who wish to learn elementary calculus must have an understanding of arithmetic and basic algebra (manipulating algebraic expressions and solving algebraic equations).  It is helpful but not necessary to be familiar with trigonometry (sine, cosine, and tangent as ratios within the unit circle and their application to geometry) and analytic geometry (parabolas, hyperbolas, conic sections, and other related functions) - these can be learned while studying the calculus.

It is important to note that *learning this topic is not nearly as difficult as its "scary" reputation might suggest*.  Do not be put off by the word "calculus" - all readers who have a good grasp of basic math and basic algebra will be able to learn its techniques.  Understanding the ideas behind the techniques will require you to solve many problems, think about the concepts,  and eventually study theorems, but anyone can learn calculus itself.  Readers should think of elementary calculus as being merely the basic grammar of science.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to study calculus should pick a good introductory textbook and work through it chapter-by-chapter.  These books tend to be very expensive, so readers may wish to choose a cheaper, older edition for self-study.  It is very important to solve as many problems given in each section as possible - this is not just to test your reading; working (and sometimes struggling) with these problems is a necessary part of gaining proficiency in the techniques of calculus.  Success will come with practice, and practice means solving problems.

At the end of a study of elementary calculus, readers should understand functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals, and should also be familiar with trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions as well as sequences and series.  This will prepare the reader to go on to study the mathematical laws of the physical sciences.  Readers who wish to learn mathematics in more depth may wish to study analysis next, which covers the theorems and proofs behind calculus in far more depth.  However, this will require an understanding of basic logic and the techniques needed to constructing proofs.

Readers who wish to study the physical sciences or engineering will discover that elementary calculus is only the first set of techniques they must master - the next steps are to learn multivariable calculus and differential equations.  Multivariable calculus extends the techniques of calculus to functions of many variables (for example, one can find the volume of a geometric shape by integrating over the interior of the three-dimensional figure).  This should culminate in a study of calculus applied to vector spaces, also known as vector calculus.  In the study of differential equations, readers will learn how to find functions that solve equations containing derivatives - and most of the universe's rules are written in the form of differential equations.

#Linear Algebra#

"Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as linear functions such as and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions. Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and engineering areas, because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. For nonlinear systems, which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, linear algebra is often used as a first-order approximation." -Wikipedia

#Set Theory#

Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects.

**Prerequisites:**

Since set theory is a fundamental topic it doesn’t require any specific prerequisites. But, some mathematical maturity in the reader is needed to appreciate the relevance of some of the definitions and theorems. Depending on the set theory course, you may need first a course where you learn to write proofs. Or, that may be the emphasis of the set theory course itself.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who want to learn set theory should start with an introductory text book. A list of excellent choices is presented below. But, readers should be aware that there are a lot of books that teach set theory in “naive approach”. For a more complete understanding of the subject, an “axiomatic approach” must complement the naive approach. Since set theory is a first year undergraduate course, some readers might find set theory different to topics they have faced in high school. The sudden focus on proofs on seemingly “trivial” topics might be tedious for readers, but it is necessary to understand that rigorous proofs of fundamental results ensures integrity of mathematics as a whole. Readers might find taking written notes more helpful in understanding the subject.

**Books:**

* [Book of Proof](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)

* [Elements of Set Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Set-Theory-Herbert-Enderton/dp/0122384407)

* [Naive Set Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Set-Theory-Paul-Halmos/dp/1614271313) *Stands the test of time. We recommend this to learn from.

#Complex Analysis#

'Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including the branches of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and particularly quantum mechanics. By extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering" [-Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Complex_analysis)

#Tensor Calculus#

“In mathematics, tensor calculus, tensor analysis, or Ricci calculus is an extension of vector calculus to tensor fields (tensors that may vary over a manifold, e.g. in spacetime).
Developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita it was used by Albert Einstein to develop his theory of general relativity. Contrasted with the infinitesimal calculus, tensor calculus allows presentation of physics equations in a form that is independent of the choice of coordinates on the manifold.
Tensor calculus has many real-life applications in physics and engineering, including elasticity, continuum mechanics, electromagnetism (see mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field), general relativity (see mathematics of general relativity) and quantum field theory.” [-Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tensor_calculus)

#Functional Analysis#

Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e.g. inner product, norm, topology, etc.) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining continuous, unitary etc. operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations. [-Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Functional_analysis)

#Physics#

Physics is the study of matter and energy, and seeks to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level.  The goal of physics is to come up with mathematical rules that can accurately predict and explain all of the various phenomena of our universe.

**Prerequisites:**

Studying physics at the high-school or conceptual level requires a good understanding of basic math and algebra.  University-level physics requires calculus, since the mathematical laws of physics involve instantaneous rates of change.  Readers who wish to learn physics at this level must understand limits, derivatives, and integrals, and should eventually study linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and differential equations after moving on to more advanced subtopics.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to start learning physics should begin by obtaining an introductory textbook, which will typically cover basic mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and a few selected topics in modern physics.  Introductory textbooks can be roughly divided by depth and difficulty into high-school, conceptual (algebra-based), and university (calculus-based) levels.  Readers who are familiar with elementary calculus should start with a university-level text.  Those wishing to make a serious study of physics should first learn calculus and then study a university-level text.  It is very important to study the chosen textbook methodically, chapter-by-chapter, and it is especially important to solve the problems found at the end of each section.  There is no substitute for solving many problems on your own when it comes to understanding physics.

You may wish to supplement your textbook reading with conceptual readings (like the Feynman lectures on Physics) and lectures appropriate to your level.  These may help you think about your reading, but cannot replace studying a textbook deeply and solving physics problems.  Once you finish the introductory text, you should be ready to move on to specialized subtopics - start with a more in-depth study of classical mechanics.

#Classical Mechanics#

Classical mechanics is the oldest subtopic within physics; it contains the ideas first discovered at the turn of the 17th century by Sir Isaac Newton, the father of modern physics.  Classical mechanics is the study of the motion of "everyday things" - its goal is to use mathematical rules to predict the behavior of ordinary objects when acted upon by forces.

**Prerequisites:**

* [General Physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ajm6ex/physics/)

* [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ak9let/multivariable_calculus/)

* [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgt8r/differential_equations/)


**Where to Start:**

Readers should start with a standard classical mechanics text, reading each chapter methodically and solving the problems found at the end of each chapter.  As with general physics, there is no substitute for solving lots of problems - this is the only way to truly understand classical mechanics.  Textbooks can be divided into undergraduate- and graduate-level; readers should start with undergraduate texts before attempting the more advanced works on the subject.  *Those who are self-studying and have just completed general physics should start by studying Taylor's book.*

The study of classical mechanics begins with a review of Newtonian methods and concepts but at a deeper level, with new techniques and in more general or complex situations.  Eventually readers will study the calculus of variations, a very important technique that makes new types of calculations possible and is very important in more advanced topics.  Most basic texts will also have introductory sections on special relativity, in which you will discover that our principles of classical mechanics are only low-velocity approximations of the more general and far stranger rules of relativistic motion.  Readers may wish to continue on to a more modern treatment of classical mechanics, which will require an understanding of differential geometry.

After completing a study of classical mechanics, readers trying to obtain a basic education in physics should move on to electrodynamics (which will require an understanding of multivariable calculus and vector calculus) or quantum mechanics (which requires linear algebra and, for some topics, multivariable calculus).  It will become increasingly important to improve your knowledge of mathematical methods as you progress into more advanced subtopics.

**Subtopics:**

#Electrodynamics#

Electrodynamics (or "Electricity and Magnetism", as it is sometimes called in introductory courses) is the study of the interaction between matter with electric charge and the electric and magnetic fields.  Electric charges create these fields and also experience forces in their presence, and electrodynamics seeks to understand the mathematical laws governing this relationship.

**Prerequisites:**

Before studying electrodynamics in depth, readers should have completed a study of general physics by working through an university-level introductory text.  Readers should also have completed a classical mechanics text, but this is not necessarily required; these two subtopics can be studied in parallel.  Elementary calculus is required, and readers should also be familiar with vectors.  Understanding vector and multivariable calculus is also recommended.

* [Multivariable Calculus]()

* [Vector Calculus] *No technical bib on this, math methods and most Multivariable textbooks will teach this*

* [Ordinary Differential Equations]() *Grad Level*

* [Partial Differential Equations]()*Grad Level*

**Where to Start:**

Just as with general physics, readers who wish to study electrodynamics should begin by picking up an introductory textbook.  This textbook should be read diligently, chapter-by-chapter, and readers should complete as many of the problems given at the end of each section as possible.  Reading through the textbook will not suffice - readers will discover that they don't really understand the concepts until they've wrestled with a few tough problems. For those who are new to electrodynamics, having only worked through university-level general physics, the recommended textbook is Griffiths.

Eventually, readers will learn that the electric and magnetic fields are two aspects of the same field and that propagating electromagnetic fields (a.k.a light) travel at the same constant speed in all cases - even from the perspectives of two people moving at different velocities!  Reconciling this strange fact with our ordinary notions of classical mechanics led to the theory of special relativity published by Einstein in 1905.  Classical mechanics and electrodynamics form the foundation of a good physics education, so after completing electrodynamics, readers will be ready to study relativity, quantum mechanics, or any other advanced subtopic.  But it is very important to study differential equations, linear algebra, and other mathematical methods in parallel with physics, since these become increasingly crucial as you move into more modern, advanced fields.

 #**Preliminary:**

Math methods is completely different than Mathematical Physics. Do not confuse either subject/field. Math Methods is not a field of physics, rather a field of internal instruction for physics majors.

Math Methods bridges the gap between Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra/Ordinary Differential Equations to complex mathematical areas which Physics Majors need to be fluent in, but not masters in. For example, most Physicists and/or majors do not need to be proficient in most areas of Real Analysis, Group Theory or Probability and Statistics. Some proficiency is required, but not to the level as Mathematicians and/or majors would need to be at. Math Methods essentially covers these areas to the degree of which you may require and not much afterwards.

In simple plain English, Math Methods takes out the bullshit and fluff that physicists don't require in their Mathematics.

#Quantum Mechanics#

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explains how the universe works at distances comparable to or smaller than the atom.  Various observations made in the late 19^th and early 20^th centuries made it clear that physics at this distance scale cannot be described by ordinary classical physics.  For example, in 1905 Albert Einstein explained an unusual aspect of the photoelectric effect (the effect behind the workings of solar cells): low-intensity, short-wavelength light was capable of knocking electrons out of a semiconductor material while high-intensity, long-wavelength light would not generate current in the material.  Einstein realized that the light must contain energy "quanta" that would interact individually with electrons in the material, which was not consistent with the classical conception of light as a continuous wave that would gradually supply enough energy for these electrons to escape.

Quantum mechanics was developed to explain these strange phenomena of tiny things.  It describes the dynamics of particles using quantized wavefunctions and expresses their observable values in terms of probabilities.  Yet, amazingly, it still "corresponds" to classical mechanics at larger distances - it extends, but does not replace, our classical physics.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers should complete a study of general physics and classical mechanics before beginning work on quantum mechanics.  In terms of mathematical experience, readers should be familiar with elementary calculus, linear algebra, and how to solve ordinary differential equations.  For the more advanced standard problems, multivariable calculus and familiarity with solving partial differential equations will also be required, and a basic knowledge of electrodynamics will also be helpful.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should begin by obtaining an introductory quantum mechanics textbook - for the beginner, Griffiths' text is probably the best choice.  It is important to study each chapter in depth and work as many problems as possible at the end of each section.  The core of a basic introduction to quantum physics is a study of canonical problems - free particles, potential wells, harmonic oscillators, and the Coulomb potential - readers should eventually be able to compute the basis wavefunctions for each of these standard potentials.  And, just as with every other subtopic in physics, understanding is gradually developed as you solve many problems.  After completing Griffiths, readers can move on to graduate-level texts like Shankar.

By the time you finish your initial study of quantum mechanics, you should understand the correspondence between the laws of classical and quantum mechanics, understand that Schrodinger's equation allows a derivation of the energy basis for wavefunctions, understand the time-dependence of wavefunctions, be able to compute expectation values for observable quantities, be able to find the energy levels and wavefunctions for basic potentials like the infinite square well, understand the quantum harmonic oscillator and ladder operators, understand how to compute the electron energy levels in the Hydrogen atom, and be able to use perturbative methods to study small changes in quantum systems.  Many of these concepts, particularly the harmonic oscillator and perturbation theory, are extremely important in more advanced quantum theory.

Quantum mechanics is just the first step in understanding how the universe works at very small scales and how our macroscopic world can be an emergent feature of the universe's most fundamental physics.  It was quickly realized that ordinary quantum mechanics is incompatible with special relativity (it cannot describe the very small *and* the very fast).  Quantum field theory developed from the need for a quantum theory that is consistent with special relativity and can describe processes in which particles are created or destroyed (as observed from radioactive decay or inelastic scattering within particle colliders).  The next steps in understanding the most fundamental theories of physics are to study particle physics and quantum field theory, although this will require significant additional mathematical knowledge (e.g. complex analysis).

**Subtopics:**

#Statistical Mechanics#

**Description:**

"Statistical mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physics. It is necessary for the fundamental study of any physical system that has many degrees of freedom. The approach is based on statistical methods, probability theory and the microscopic physical laws. It can be used to explain the thermodynamic behavior of large systems." -Wikipedia


**Preliminary:**

I do want to say before a user starts this Bibliography, that this was one of the most difficult Bibs I've had to make in regards to the textbooks. For some reason, the textbooks pertaining to this field aren't highly regarded, nor are they usually well written. I have a hard time recommending any undergraduate textbook for Stat Mech or Thermodynamics:

* Kittel & Kroemer hasn't been updated in over 40 years and the publishers are still asking nearly $150 for the book (at the time this bib was published). It is usually recommended in lieu of Schroeder.

* Schroeder is typically used for intro Statistical Mechanics, and in most forums, is usually disliked, wherein most users refer to Kittel & Kroemer as their preferred textbook. This begins a cycle where one users hates Kittel & Kroemer and recommends Schroeder, another user comes in and recommends Kittel & Kroemer and thus continues the cycle.

* Reif is known for it's usage for obscure notation, unnecessarily formality, and clarity issues. Some users state it is the best book, while others want to burn it in a fire.

* Herbert B. Callen: Published and not revised since 1985. "In the preface to this second edition, Callen described his 25-year-old postulatory approach to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics as "now widely accepted".  In fact, by the time of his second edition, his approach was completely outdated, because it springs from nineteenth-century ideas of thermodynamics in which concepts such as entropy were not understood.  This means that Callen simply postulated the core quantities such as entropy and temperature with essentially no context, and without providing any physical insight or analysis.  It might all look streamlined, but his approach will give you no insight into the difficult and interesting questions of the subject.  Callen described his approach as rendering the subject transparent and simple; but his approach comes across as obscure.  For example, in the early part of the book, he insists on repeatedly writing "1/T1 = 1/T2" for two temperatures that are ascertained to be equal, when anyone else would write "T1 = T2".  And, for what he does write, the devil is often in the details that he tends to leave out.  Even at the start, when Callen introduces the concept of work, he fails to say whether he is talking about the work done on the system, or by the system, leaving the reader to work that out for himself from some irrelevant comments about the mechanical work term −P dV.  Callen's incorrect renditions of the Taylor expansion in an appendix seem to suggest, rather oddly, that he didn't understand the difference between "dx" and "Δx".  His book includes a 20-page postscript in which he makes claims about the role of symmetry in thermodynamics; but, as far as I can tell, this section says nothing useful at all.  I suspect that the reason this book is as frequently cited as it is said to be lies in its being used as the basis for a course by many lecturers who never learned the subject themselves, and hence don't reseal that the book's approach is outdated.  If you really want to learn the subject, use the modern statistical approach, in which entropy is defined to relate to numbers of configurations.  As far as readability goes, Callen's writing tends to omit commas; but this can make his sentences tedious to read, since the reader ends up having to make two or three passes to decode what some sentences are saying.  (If you use few commas yourself, study a typical sentence in Callen's book: "the intermediate states of the gas are non equilibrium states for which the enthalpy is not defined".  Callen is not singling out a special set of non-equilibrium states here; instead, enthalpy is not defined for any non-equilibrium state.  He should have included a single comma, by writing "the intermediate states of the gas are non-equilibrium states, for which the enthalpy is not defined".)

#LaTeX#

LaTeX is a typesetting language built on TeX that makes it very easy to produce high-quality documents, and is especially useful in the creation of mathematical and scientific works due to the ease with which mathematical formulae can be written.  LaTeX is a simple markup language similar to HTML, although it can be extended with packages and with some effort the underlying TeX can be used like any programming language.  This bibliography covers only the basics of using LaTeX; it does not cover the TeX typesetting language itself or the many packages that extend the functionality of LaTeX.

**Prerequisites:**

Getting started with LaTeX only requires a computer; all of the needed programs are free.   It is a very simple language and requires no previous programming experience.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to start creating documents with LaTeX should first install a LaTeX distribution and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  The distribution contains the compilers that convert your LaTeX code into a well-formatted postscript or PDF file.  The IDE is not strictly necessary but makes it much easier to create LaTeX documents.  Follow these steps:

1.  **Install a distribution of LaTeX.**  It is recommended that you install MiKTeX, a very popular distribution.  The Windows installer can be found [here](http://miktex.org/download).  It is also possible to install this distribution on computers using [Linux](http://miktex.org/howto/build-unx) or [Mac](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) operating systems.

2. **Install an IDE.**  Readers who are familiar with Microsoft Word may wish to use [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org), which has an interface that is very similar to a Windows word processor.  Another choice that is good for beginners is [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), which is also available for Linux and Mac.

While installing the IDE, you may be asked to provide the installer with the directory where your LaTeX compiler is located.  If you've installed MiKTeX, the compiler location from the MiKTeX directory is \miktex\bin\latex.exe.  You may also need to install a postscript viewer - a good open-source choice is GSview (install [Ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com) and then [GSView](http://www.gsview.com)).  You may also want to install [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) in order to convert picture files into the encapsulated postscript (eps) format required to include them in LaTeX documents.

Once you have your distribution and IDE installed, try creating a new document.  A good first document can be found [here](http://latex-project.org/intro.html). You'll see that the code is quite simple and similar to HTML, another markup language.  The document consists of plaintext and simple commands of the basic form \\*command*[*optional_parameters*]{*argument*}.  Type in the code from the given link and compile it to a PDF file using the appropriate IDE command.  A good rule of thumb is to compile documents two or three times; the compiler uses output from previous compilations to update links between different parts of the document, to insert appropriate numbers in enumerated lists, and for various other reasons.  Try typing the following code into your editor and then compiling it to create your first LaTeX document:

    \documentclass{article}

    \begin{document}
    Hello World!
    \end{document}


To continue learning how to write LaTeX documents, readers may wish to go through ["The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX 2ε"](https://docs.google.com/viewer?docex=1&url=https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf), an outstanding introduction to the language.  As you gain experience, you will find additional packages to do more with LaTeX.  These packages will significantly extend the functionality of LaTeX; it is even possible to create Powerpoint-like presentations using Beamer.  Readers may eventually wish to learn how to modify LaTeX with new commands and environments, how to create their own packages, and how to modify LaTeX itself by learning more about TeX.
